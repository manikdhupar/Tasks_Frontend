How to opmitize websites

Some of the things to look for which can cause website to slow down - 

1.) Minify JS,CSS and use external css - use minified files.

2.) Compressing Images - Majorly if a website is slow, images are causing your website to slow down.
                         Images should be compressed.

3.) Scaling Images - Do not resize images through html and css. Always scale images before. 

4.) LAZY LOADING(Highly useful in SPA) - The downside of SPA'S(React) is that the initial Loading time is quite Highly
    and this can be solved using lazy loading i.e load components only when they are needed. Only when a request is send
    to the route(react router) that renders that component, only then the component should load.

5.) async over sync - Since Javascript is single threaded, we dont want to block the main thread.Therefore every request that is time
    consuming(eg - network request, database fetch) should be async so that our main thread is not blocked and our browser dont get stuck during that operation.

6.) Adding external css stylesheet instead of inline,etc.
