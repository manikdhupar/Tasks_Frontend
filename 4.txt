Js Animation vs CSS Animation

Depends on the state which one to choose

If the animation can be done with css, css should be choosen due to following reasons -> 

a) Cost - Javascript is expensive than css. Apart from loading, it has to be parsed and then compiled(on the fly).
b) If there is some bug, whole app would crash but in case of css at max the css would crash which is less harmful.
c) Sometimes browser optimises the css and js dont have access to these api's(Reference from stackOverflow).


Which of the two i use - Both
1.) Complex-  If animation is simple, I use css transition, else I use javascript for complex animations.

2.) If no element triggers the animation - Always use css animation(Applies the animation is not too complex)

3.)For events like onclick,scroll,etc choose javascript for animation.
