Difference betweeen flex float and grid.

Flex was introduced with flexbox.
Grid was introduced with css grid.
Float was not introduced to make columns or rows or grids.

Float - Float is used when you want elements to float around i.e come next to each other.
        Eg - if you want to keep image and text next to each other. We can use floats over here.
        Or If there are many images and we want them to be side by side. We can use floats.(Not intended)


        NOTE :  CLEARFIX class should be applied so as after this elements wont float around.

Flexbox - Flexbox was the first attempt to make columns or rows. Floats can have problems, so flexbox
          was introduced.

          With flexbox it is much easy to crete columns. apply display:flex to parent and now the children
          would be flex items. We can flex-wrap:wrap so that the flex-items would now be adjusted with the
          responsiveness and we can give flex-basis to tell how much items should come in one row at given viewport size.

          Centering things vertically become very easy with flexbox.

          Flexbox is only for row or only for column.

Grid -  Since flexbox is only for row or only for column. Grid works in 2-dimension.
        Grid solves the problem of flexbox for 2-D and it is very easy to create layout using grid.

My pick - I use flexbox or grid for one container element(and not whole document) and how you want to layout that element and its child.
          Mostly i use flexbox, because there are rare cases when you cant solve a problem using flexbox, then you need to switch to grid
          but flexbox almost solves the issues. Also flexbox has better browser support than grid.
