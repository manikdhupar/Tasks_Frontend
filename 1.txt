position - Fixed,sticky,relative,absolute.

1.) Fixed - An element with fixed position is displayed with respect to the viewport/browser window.
            This element would remain at that exact position even if user scrolls.
            Also it does not effect the flow of elements.

2.) Sticky- This behaves like fixed after a certain time(When the scroll finishes) it gets fixed.
            It behaves like relative at starting and after certain scroll it gets fixed.
            This effects flow of elements.(It occupies space).

USE CASES OF FIXED AND STICKY - 1.) Adds
                                2.) Navbar
                                3.) Customer chat support pop up box
                                4.) Whatsapp link displayed for contact purpose.


3.) Relative - USE-CASE : When you have to move an element without disturbing the document flow(Everything stays at their place).
                          By setting position:relative, nothing would happend unless you apply top,left,bottom or right.
                          Now it would be relative to itself.
4.) Absolute - Unlike relative, it actually floats around.
                It is absolute in respect to the postitioning context(container).
                If parent has a postion:relative property, and child has absolute property then the origin
                would be the starting point of parent.(and we can position child element using top,left,bottom and right).

                NOTE -  Absolute is relative to its parent whose position is set relative, if no parent's 
                        position is set relative, it gets relative to the body.

USE -CASES OF RELATIVE AND ABSOLUTE - When you have to move things around in your document.
